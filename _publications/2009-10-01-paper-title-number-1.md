We introduce a family of sparse random linear network codes with outer-code. Due to the bold role of the incomplete gamma function in their design, we call these codes “Gamma codes”. We show that Gamma codes outperform all the existing linear-complexity network coding solutions in terms of reception overhead, while keeping the encoding and decoding complexity linear in the block length.
