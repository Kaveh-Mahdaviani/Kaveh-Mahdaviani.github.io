We consider a streaming communication system
where the source packets must be played back sequentially at
the destination and study the associated average playback delay.
We assume that all the source packets are available before the
start of transmission at the transmitter and consider the case
of an i.i.d. erasure channel with perfect feedback. We first
consider the case when the receiver buffer can be arbitrarily
large, and show that the average playback delay remains bounded
in the length of the stream provided that the channel bandwidth
is greater than a critical threshold. Our analysis involves the
application of martingale theory to study the transient behaviour
of a one dimensional random walk with drift. Conversely when
the channel bandwidth is smaller than the above threshold,
the average playback delay increases linearly with the stream
length. We also consider the finite buffer case and analyse the
playback delay of a greedy dynamic bandwidth scheme. We
further show through simulations that the achievable delay with
a finite receiver buffer is close to the infinite buffer case for
moderately large buffer values.
