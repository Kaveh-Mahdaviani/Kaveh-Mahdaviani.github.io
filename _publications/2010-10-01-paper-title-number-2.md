In this paper, we present the first large-scale field study of NAND-based SSDs
deployed in enterprise storage systems. Our study is based on
field data, collected over 2.5 years, for a sample of almost 1.4 million drives from the total SSD population of a major enterprise storage vendor
(NetApp). The data allows us to study a large number of factors that were not
included in prior work, such as the effect of firmware versions, the reliability
of TLC NAND, and correlations between drives within a RAID group. Our
analysis provides insight into flash reliability, along with a number of practical implications.
